# Dogs vs Cats Classifier
Data Science project that utilizes deep learning convolutional neural network for image classification.
## Project Overview
*	The images dataset was obtained from the Kaggle competition Dogs vs. Cats
*	Created functions to preprocess the images data into numpy array using cv2 so that it can be feed into the models.
*	Plotting of graph to ensure that the data has been correctly imported.
*	Train the model using a baseline CNN.
*	Improve on the result by utilizing pre-trained CNN VGG16 and fine tuning it to achieve an accuracy of around 90% 
*	Appending the result into an excel file and upload it into the Kaggle competition

## Resources Used
* Python Version: 3.7
* Packages: os, cv2, numpy, matplotlib, pickle, tensorflow, tensorflow.keras
